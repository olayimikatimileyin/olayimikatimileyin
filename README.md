Scaling your business shouldn’t feel like juggling chainsaws.

You’re a founder..

Your days are a blur of product launches, team meetings, and investor updates. 

You’re drowning in spreadsheets, drowning in Slack pings, drowning in the operational chaos that steals time from the work that matters to your vision.

Here’s the truth: You don’t have to do this alone.

I’m not just another analyst. I take ownership of your operations. The sales, the growth, and the management so you and your team can focus on what you do best: building something extraordinary.
